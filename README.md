# Learning Management System

## 1. Project Overview

The **MERN Stack LMS** lets users browse courses, view success stories, and manage content based on roles. The backend uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while React.js powers a dynamic, responsive frontend. Admins manage courses and stories, and students can enroll in courses. JWT authentication and role-based access ensure security.
